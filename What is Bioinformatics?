Bioinformatics is as the name suggests the study of biological information: genes,genomes, proteins, cells etc.
and applying "informatics" techniques ( could be applied math, computer science, staatistics) to understand the information and organize the information.

What we want? we want the functionality of the protein, Bioinformatics help to give 3D structure.
So, raw sequence are used to produce 3D structure of the protein and then it can be studied in a better way.

Central Dogma is most important, as it is the coding region. 
Bioinformatics builds mathematical models of these processes. 


DATA TYPES 

1. Primary database                       DNA, RNA
AATGGCGTATAGCG                            amino acids
(Raw data)

2. Secondary database                     Secondary protein structure
motifs: regualr expressions,              alpha-helices, beta-strands
blocks, fingerprints

3. Tertiary Database                       Tertiary protein structure
atomic co-ordinates                         domains, folding units

Now, What are databases?
                  ____________major Databases____________
specialized databases                               Generalised databases

1. ESTs (expresses seq tags)                        ___________|__________________
2. STSs (seq-tagged sites)                         |                              |                    
3. SNPs ( Single nucleotide)              Protein databses                      DNA ( Nucleotide) databases
                                        ___________|__________                  1. GenBank at NCBI

Pairwise Alignment
1. Needleman-Wunch algorithm ( Global)                1970
best score from among alignment of full length sequence

2. Smith-Waterman algorithm (Local)                   1981
best score from among alignment of partial sequence

Why do we need local alignments?
** to compare a short sequence to a large one
** to compare4 a single sequence to an entire database
** to compare a partial sequence to the whole
** to identify newly determined sequences
Introduction to FASTA and BLAST

Short lengths of exact matches a better approch for both

FASTA                                                 1988
Pearson & Lipman
** was faster
Derived from DOT plot
-- -- method looks for exact matches b/w word in query and test sequence
   -- DNA word are 6 nucleotide long
   -- protein words are 2 amino acids long

FASTA OUTLINE

*** step 1
# identify K-words b/w I and j
# the dot matrix can be plotted for various k
***  step 2
Now we score diagonal in the matrix
***  Step 3
Rescoring initial region with substitution method
*** step 4
join initial region with gaps, penalize for gaps

FASTA score
Init value?
number of diagonal matches

Z-score?
In an easy language how much our actual score is deviated from random score
Z = (meanX)/ SD

E Value = probability of Z value is called E value
we want less E value and less z score. E score below 10^-6 are most 
probably statistically significant.

FASTA Format?
A simple formal used by almost all the programs
starts with a (>) header
sequence with capital letters


# Basic Local Alignment Search Technique
BLAST  and kept on updating                           1990
now days BLAST(Kent)                                  2002
** fast
** easy to use
** more sensitive
Blast can not handle gaps well
 uses Heuristic method

Input of BLAST
- query sequence Q
- databse of sequence DB
- minimal score S

Output of data sequence 
- Sequence from DB(seq), such that Q and seq have scores > S

The result of the word matching and attempts to extend the alignment are segments
- called HSPs
