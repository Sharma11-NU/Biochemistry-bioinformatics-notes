Bioinformatics is as the name suggests the study of biological information: genes,genomes, proteins, cells etc.
and applying "informatics" techniques ( could be applied math, computer science, staatistics) to understand the information and organize the information.

What we want? we want the functionality of the protein, Bioinformatics help to give 3D structure.
So, raw sequence are used to produce 3D structure of the protein and then it can be studied in a better way.

Central Dogma is most important, as it is the coding region. 
Bioinformatics builds mathematical models of these processes. 


DATA TYPES 

1. Primary database                       DNA, RNA
AATGGCGTATAGCG                            amino acids
(Raw data)

2. Secondary database                     Secondary protein structure
motifs: regualr expressions,              alpha-helices, beta-strands
blocks, fingerprints

3. Tertiary Database                       Tertiary protein structure
atomic co-ordinates                         domains, folding units

Now, What are databases?
                  ____________major Databases____________
