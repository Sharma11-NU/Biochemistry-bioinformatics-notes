DNA is a polymer made up of monomeric unit called Nucleotides.

Now what is NUcleotide? It is made up of  5 carbon sugars (deoxuribose), a nitrogen base and 1 or more than one phosphate group.
So,
DNA has 3 components
                      
1. Nitrogenenous base        2. Deoxyribose        3. Phosphates

     \                             /                    /
       is called Nucleoside together                   /
                          \                           /                        
                           \                         /
                              is called Nucleotide
Nitrogenous base:- Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine.
DNA is 2 stranded helical structure - run in opposite direction, i.e., 5' to 3' and vice-versa.
It is right handed. Hence, rotations are clockwise down the axis.

DNA Replication
1. It need chromatin environment.
2. It is semiconservative.
