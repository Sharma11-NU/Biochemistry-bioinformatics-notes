If I have to expain DNA in a very basic language, DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. It carries genetic information that makes a living thing perform the basic functions.
It also can copy this genetic information and passes this infomation to the next generation...magical right?. This magic happens because of the Double helix structure of DNA.
We will learn 1. How DNA is packed in chromosomes
              2. How it is replicated
