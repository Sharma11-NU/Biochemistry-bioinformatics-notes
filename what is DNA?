My Biotechnology Notes

If I have to expain DNA in a very basic language, DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. It carries genetic information that makes a living thing perform the basic functions.
It also can copy this genetic information and passes this infomation to the next generation...magical right?. This magic happens because of the Double helix structure of DNA.

We will learn 1. How DNA is packed in chromosomes
              2. How it is replicated
To move further, there are some basic terminology that is necessary for us to know. 
Understanding these terms will help us navigate the subject more effectively and build a solid foundation for deeper learning.

1. GENE: it is a segment of DNA that contains Code/instructions for making a specific protein.
2. GENOME: It is complete set of DNA.
        Ex: Human Genome -> DNA in |---- 23 pairs of Chromosomes
                                   |---- mitochondrial genome
                
Extra FACTS
> Human Genome is diploid
> Friedrich Miescher was actually looking for structure of white Blood cells (Leucocytes), but  accidentally descoved Nuclein.
> Erwin Chargoff found DNA from a particular species always had same amount of C (Cytosine) - G (Guanine) and A (Adenosine) - T(Thymine)
> Human Genome has C and G 20% , A and T 30%

DNA is a polymer made up of monomeric unit called Nucleotides.

Now what is NUcleotide? It is made up of  5 carbon sugars (deoxuribose), a nitrogen base and 1 or more than one phosphate group.
So,
DNA has 3 components
                      
1. Nitrogenenous base        2. Deoxyribose        3. Phosphates
    \                               /                    /
     \                             /                    /
       is called Nucleoside together                   /
                          \                           /                        
                           \                         /
                              is called Nucleotide
Nitrogenous base:- Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine.
DNA is 2 stranded helical structure - run in opposite direction, i.e., 5' to 3' and vice-versa.
It is right handed. Hence, rotations are clockwise down the axis.

DNA Replication
1. It need chromatin environment.
2. It is semiconservative.
