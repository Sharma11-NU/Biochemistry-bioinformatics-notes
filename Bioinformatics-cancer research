Notes on Cancer Biology 101

What is Cancer? in my own language to explain it in very non-technical terms
If a healthy cell that grows and divide and then die, becames malignant (immortal).
now, it keep on dividing and started to pile up in a certain region, that is called malignant tumor.
and when this tumor becames regressive and transferable to other region of the body it is cancer.

Why a healthy cell becomes a bad guy?
Many factors can result in this malfunction like Eating habit, environment, any kind of radiations/ uv.

Application of bioinformatics in cancer reseach

Here example for explaining the use of bioinformatics in cancer study , colon cancer is used.
Colon cancer stages :
stage 1
stage 2
stage 3
stage 4
stage 5

Now, how to use bioinformatics?
Bioinformatics is like a tool to study data.
data base by maintained by WHO provide a data for every body to use.
Using String database, we can see how biomarkers are related to a certsin cancer.
it helps to develop a pathway.
using R we generate heat map that help in understanding if genes are up regulated or down regulated.
